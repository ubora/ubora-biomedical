                        This standard specifies requirements for designers and manufacturers of medical devices, in order to minimize the risk of the device itself. There is no “risk zero” device but many activities can be implemented to reduce and manage risk. This standard provides useful checklists and also guidance on the most widespread risk management techniques such as FMEA.
