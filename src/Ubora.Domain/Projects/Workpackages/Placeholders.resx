    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="ClinicalNeeds" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should describe the clinical need that is the target of your device.
•	Example 1: write the common or technical name of the pathology, describe the main symptoms and if it is acute/chronic.
Example 2: write the common or technical name of the handicap, describe if it is innate or caused by incidents or a consequence of a pathology
Example 3: describe what is the patient need in terms of cost / improvement of life conditions / improvement of wellbeing
•	Worked example 1: Down syndrome is a syndrome linked to various conditions, from lowered cognitive functions to increased risk of heart failure
•	Worked example 2: congenital club foot is a disease of newborn children that impairs the development of the lower limbs
•	Worked example 3: patients with high body temperature (fever) need to assess their body temperature every 1-4 hours in a quick and reliable manner</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ExistingSolutions" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should describe what are the devices or therapies on the market; if possible, list some pros and cons of the existing solutions.
•	Example: list medical, surgical or technical solutions available; define the criteria to choose amongst the have different options. Comment on residual side effects or contraindications that may be improved.
•	Worked example: congenital club foot is usually treated by braces (mild cases) or surgery. Both solutions require long healing times and frequent specialistic follow up visits.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="IntendedUsers" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should describe what your end user prefers or needs; this may be the same or different than the patient need and relates more to "easy and friendly to use" that to patient state of health.
•	Example: describe if the device should be lightweight to be portable; describe the sounds and colors that are expected; describe handling and visual requirements
•	Worked example 1: a defibrillator for use in airports and other meeting places should be very intuitive to use and should give vocal commands in the language that is common for the end users
•	Worked example 2: a surgery blade shall have a handle that ensures a safe grip even if it is wet</value>
  </data>
  <data name="PhysicalPrinciples" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should describe the most important operating physical principle of your medical device.
•	Example 1: Contactless Infrared Thermometer
•	Worked example 1: An infrared thermometer is a device that measures the infrared radiation – a type of electromagnetic radiation below the visible spectrum of light - emitted by an object. The most basic design of infrared thermometers consists of a lens to focus the infrared thermal radiation onto a detector, which converts the radiant energy into an electric signal. This configuration facilitates temperature measurement from a distance, without the need for contact with the object to be measured. The device is useful for measuring temperature under circumstances where thermocouples or other probe type sensors cannot be used.</value>

  <data name="ProductRequirements" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should describe all the requirements to certain product. It is written to allow people to understand what a product should do.
Typical components of a product requirements document are:
•	Functional requirements 
o	Describe how your product will meet and solve the clinical need.
	Example 1: describe how the device interacts with the human body and why this interaction is beneficial.
	Worked example 1: the syringe allows to deliver liquid substances, for example drugs, to the peripheral blood stream of the patient by piercing the vein walls without laceration.
•	Usability requirements
o	Describe who will use the device and if they need special training.
	Example 1: define the professional profile of the end user.
	Worked example 1: a hip implant can be implanted in the patient only by a surgery team; all components of the surgery team are medical professional and at least one specialized orthopedic surgeon shall be responsible of the surgery.
•	Safety requirements
o	Describe the main risks that your device may pose to the patient, to the users and bystanders and to the general environment. Propose solutions if you are aware of them.
	Example 1: evaluate electrical and mechanical safety of the device 
	Worked example 1: haemodialysis machine is powered by electricity, there is a risk of electrocution of the patient and operator if it is not well insulated. In the same machine, the roller pump may hurt the operator hands if it is touched while it is rotating. Possible solutions include insulating the electrical connections and protecting the moving parts with covers or lids

•	Interaction requirements 
o	Describe how the product should work with other systems.</value>
