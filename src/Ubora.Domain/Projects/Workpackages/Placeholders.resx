    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  </data>
  <data name="PatientPopulationStudy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should describe how many patients you suppose would need your device, and give description of their state of health and any subgroups.

Example 1: evaluate how many patients are registered for the target pathology in your country/ worldwide and comment any differences.

Worked example 1: neonatal hypothermia affects xxx% of preterm children and xx% of babies at term. This means an estimate of xxx babies per year worldwide.

Example 2: evaluate how the current patient population may evolve over time/ as developing countries increase their access to health services

Worked example 2: Age related dementia affects xxx% population in the USA; similar numbers may be found in Europe, varying from xx% of Italy to xx% of Russia. In developing countries, as the life expectancy is lower, this pathology is found in xx% of population that is xx% of population in the age group 65 and older.</value>

  <data name="ProductFunctionality" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should briefly describe your device and how it works. Describe how your product will meet and solve the clinical need.

Example 1: describe how the device interacts with the human body and why this interaction is beneficial.

Worked example 1: the syringe allows to deliver liquid substances, for example drugs, to the peripheral blood stream of the patient by piercing the vein walls without laceration

Example 2: describe which clinical parameter is measures/ altered/ affected by the device

Worked example 2: the oximeter allows measuring the amount of circulating haemoglobin by evaluation of light absorption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ProductPerformance" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should describe the main working parameters of your device and why they are significant to describe its interaction with the patient.

example 1: describe the time of use, kind of interaction with the human body, forces involved

worked example 1: the haemodialysis machine allows transferring the blood from the patient body to a filter, by plastic tubings. The blood is circulated in low pressure by a peristaltic pump for some hours and continuously recirculated to the patient.

worked example 2: a dental implant is inserted by screwing it in the vital bone; after healing, the dental implant inside the bone is connected to an external abutment that sustains the mechanical forces of mastication

worked example 3: a defibrillator delivers electric energy to the chest of the patient.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ProductSafety" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here you should describe the main risks that your device may pose to the patient, to the users and bystanders and to the general environment. Propose solutions if you are aware of them.

Example 1: evaluate electrical and mechanical safety of the device 

Worked example 1: haemodialysis machine is powered by electricity, there is a risk of electrocution of the patient and operator if it is not well insulated. In the same machine, the roller pump may hurt the operator hands if it is touched while it is rotating. Possible solutions include insulating the electrical connections and protecting the moving parts with covers or lids

Example 2: evaluate biological safety of the device

Worked example 2: a needle penetrates the skin of the patient; it must be sterile and made in a material that does not cause irritation or inflammation. The same needle poses a contamination and wound hazard to the nurse after its use. At the state of the art, many metals including steel are known to be compatible with the human body and sterilizable. Means of protecting the tip after use should be provided to the operator.</value>
